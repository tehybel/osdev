For the hardware lab:

+ make graphics work
+ make sure the project still runs on virtualbox
- make a "startx" command (or use GRUB options..)
- clean up the writeup
- stress test the terminal








-------- old, low-priority stuff below ---------


- make the project run with higher optimization levels

- handle z-coordinates so that you can change which window is foregrounded

- grep for "TODO" for more

- improve unit testing framework to support i/o
- add more unit tests

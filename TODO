for the graphics subsystem:

- make the windows look nicer, maybe add a border or such
- in paint.c, mouse clicks which draw squares are a little bit off

- write a terminal emulator
- why does run-hello semi-freeze the cursor?
- 




other stuff:

- make the project run with higher optimization levels

- improve unit testing framework to support i/o
- add more unit tests

- grep for "TODO" for more

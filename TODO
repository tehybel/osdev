For the hardware lab:

- use PCI to find the IO_BASE when accessing disk
- make sure the project still runs on qemu/virtualbox
- make graphics work
- make a "startx" command
- clean up the writeup














-------- old, low-priority stuff below ---------


- we may not be sending an EOI to the LAPIC on every interrupt
- make the project run with higher optimization levels

- handle z-coordinates so that you can change which window is foregrounded

- grep for "TODO" for more

- improve unit testing framework to support i/o
- add more unit tests

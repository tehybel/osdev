for the graphics subsystem:

- some input character disappear when we type fast


- write a terminal emulator
- why does run-hello semi-freeze the cursor?
- change the generated mouse events to not just be (x, y) but to include
  movements instead, so that we can support holding a mouse button down in
  paint.c
- handle z-coordinates so that you can change which window is foregrounded
- 




other stuff:

- make the project run with higher optimization levels

- improve unit testing framework to support i/o
- add more unit tests

- grep for "TODO" for more

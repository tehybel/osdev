/**********************************************************************
 * This a dirt simple boot loader, whose sole job is to boot
 * an ELF kernel image from the first IDE hard disk.
 *
 * DISK LAYOUT
 *  * This program(boot.S and main.c) is the bootloader.  It should
 *    be stored in the first sector of the disk.
 *
 *  * The 2nd sector onward holds the kernel image.
 *
 *  * The kernel image must be in ELF format.
 *
 * BOOT UP STEPS
 *  * when the CPU boots it loads the BIOS into memory and executes it
 *
 *  * the BIOS intializes devices, sets of the interrupt routines, and
 *    reads the first sector of the boot device(e.g., hard-drive)
 *    into memory and jumps to it.
 *
 *  * Assuming this boot loader is stored in the first sector of the
 *    hard-drive, this code takes over...
 *
 *  * control starts in boot.S -- which sets up protected mode,
 *    and a stack so C code then run, then calls bootmain()
 *
 *  * bootmain() in this file takes over, reads in the kernel and jumps to it.

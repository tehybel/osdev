The goal of this "lab" is the get the OS running on real hardware.



-------------------------------------

Unpolished notes:

First we want virtualbox to work.

http://wiki.osdev.org/Disk_Images


We can create a VMDK with:

	VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /tmp/test.vmdk -rawdisk /home/imm/osdev/obj/kern/kernel.img


I had to make some minor changes to make it work in virtualbox. E.g. we must
detect when there's no e1000 and no secondary disk.

I also had to change some settings on the virtualbox machine. E.g. I had to
enable serial out (writing it to a file). I also had to attach the second
disk containing the file system. I also enabled LAPIC emulation; otherwise no
clock signals are generated and the scheduler is never called.

In this lab the idea is to implement capabilities, at least for networking.
There will be three levels:
- can network via normal connection
- can network via Tor only
- cannot use the network

We will have a special "Tor daemon" that will ensure that all networking is
performed over Tor. We can port Tor to our OS, or we can use a separate VM in
a WHONIX-style setup.

TODO clean this up:
found an old diff here:
http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~cs236376/software/qemu/e1000_debug.diff
then fixed it; include new diff. Custom compiled qemu.  

remember to export QEMU=/path/to/customqemu
and configure qemu with --target-list=i386-softmmu when compiling it


remember to show the full ./configure invocation

I had to change the line in hw/net/e1000x_common.c, from:

	trace_e1000x_rx_flt_ucast_match((int)(rp - mac - RA) / 2, MAC_ARG(buf));

To a simple printf that confirms the match. The reason is that tracing isn't
enabled by default unless we use their qemu (which isn't public).

In the first part of this lab we implement functions for manipulating
"environments"; an environment is more-or-less a synonym for "process", but we
call them environments because there are differences.

An environment holds things like the register state for a thread, a pointer to
its page directory, etc.

We also implemented a function, load_icode(), which will load an ELF file into
a user land address space.

Thus we can now create a new environment, load code into it, and even do a
context switch to run code in userland!

Unfortunately interrupts are not possible, so the processor is stuck in
userland; it will crash on the first int 0xXX instruction. Handling interrupts
is the next part of the lab.

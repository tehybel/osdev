The code in this repository is based on the MIT
[6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/) OS engineering course, which I
have covered in full by now. I'm currently adding more advanced features, such
as graphics, to the OS.

The writeups/ directory contains writeups for each branch. The current status is:

| branch   | status      | keywords                                                   |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| lab1     | done        | bootloader, mode switching                                 |
| lab2     | done        | physical memory allocator, page tables                     |
| lab3     | done        | running user-mode ELF files in an "environment" (process)  |
| lab4     | done        | preemptive multitasking, COW fork(), IPC                   |
| lab5     | done        | file system and shell                                      |
| lab6     | done        | networking                                                 |
| graphics | in progress | graphical user interface                                   |


Here's a summary of what I've done so far:

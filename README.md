This repository holds the code I write while working through the MIT
[8.626](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/) OS engineering course.

The writeups/ directory contains writeups for each lab. The current status is:
- lab1: done
- lab2: done
- lab3: done
- lab4: not yet started

Note that I am skipping the "challenge" problems for now. I am also not
writing down answers to all exercises. Thus I am doing less work than
one would when formally following the course.

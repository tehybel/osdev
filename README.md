This repository holds the code I write while working through the MIT
[8.626](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/) OS engineering course.

The writeups/ directory contains writeups for each lab. The current status is:
- lab1: done
- lab2: done
- lab3: done
- lab4: not yet started

| Address     | Running time    | L1 cache misses | Misses per query |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0x200010000 | 2.99351 seconds | 10217           | 0.00010217       |
| 0x200000000 | 3.06331 seconds | 297779497       | 2.97779497       |

Note that I am skipping the "challenge" problems for now. I am also not
writing down answers to all exercises. Thus I am doing less work than
one would when formally following the course.

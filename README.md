This repository holds the code I write while working through the MIT
[6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/) OS engineering course.

The writeups/ directory contains writeups for each lab. The current status is:

| lab  | status      | keywords                                                   |
|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| lab1 | done        | bootloader, mode switching                                 |
| lab2 | done        | physical memory allocator, page tables                     |
| lab3 | done        | running user-mode ELF files in an "environment" (process)  |
| lab4 | done        | preemptive multitasking, COW fork(), IPC                   |
| lab5 | done        | file system and shell                                      |
| lab6 | not started | ???                                                        |

Note that I am skipping the "challenge" problems for now.
